# Processing Showcase - Programming for Design (11055): Katrina Sisourath u3227598
This site is my second assignment in this unit programming for design. In this assessment I demostrated my skills in learning coding using p5j.s a javaScript library for creating coding. I have developed a small website showcasing the three exercises that is required for this assignment. The three exercises included are designing a simple logo, a simple animation and a interactive artwork all using javaScript coding. With the desigms I wanted to include primary colours of red, blue and yellow in these exercises, although the interaction exercise does not only represent the threee colours it also includes other colours.
